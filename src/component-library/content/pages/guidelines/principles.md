# Principles

This isn’t a typical component library. It’s a foundation for building fast, accessible, and maintainable websites using web fundamentals.

These principles guide how we design and maintain components across sites built on this library:


1. **🧱 Built on Web Fundamentals** — Semantic HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only when absolutely needed.

2. **🚀 Bleeding Edge Speed** — Built for the fastest delivery possible. Static-rendered, minimal payloads, zero waste.

3. **🧩 Composition First** — Build with small, focused components that can be combined to create anything. Fewer props, more building blocks.

4. **♿ Inclusive by Design** — Designed for everyone. Fully operable with keyboard and screen reader.

5. **✏️ Controlled Editing** — Developers give editors just the control they need to create without breaking consistency.
