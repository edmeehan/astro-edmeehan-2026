# Component Library

Welcome to the home of your component library.  

Here you’ll find **examples, documentation, and guidelines** for every component used across your site.

This library exists to:
  * Keep designs consistent across pages and sites  
  * Provide a single source of truth for your front-end components  
  * Make it easy for anyone to explore, edit, and extend your design system 

👉 Use the sidebar to browse components and start exploring.
